Very abstract.  Remove star, remove thankless, remove a,   replace with -  he has a special way of speaking but it seems to make him   only more like other men.

    <img style="width:100%;" src=" img/WilliamBasinski_2000.jpg ">
    The Disintegration Loops, was  created out of tape loops Basinski made back in the early 1980s. These  loops held some personal significance to Basinski, a significance he only  touches on in the liner notes and we can only guess at. The tapes were old  and were disintegrating as they played and he recorded them. As he notes in  the liner notes, 'The music was dying.' But he kept recording, documenting  the death of these loops. Basinski lives in Brooklyn, less than a nautical  mile from the World Trade Centers. On September 11, 2001, as he was  completing The Disintegration Loops, he watched these towers disintegrate.  He and his friends went on the roof of his building and played the Loops  over and over, all day long, watching the slow death of one New York and  the slow rise of another, all the while listening to the death of one music  and the creation of another. The rest is history.

    Multiple recordings of two compositions  by Arvo Part are featured on this reease. Spiegel in Spiegel may be the  best sleeping track for some, but I prefer Fur Alina. The mesmerizing  tintinnabuli score keeps fascinating as well as sleep inducing. I remember,  before knowing the score by heart that the music sometimes feels as if some  short lines are popping up and fading away circularly. A tremendous  reccomendation, also for non-classical music enthousiasts.

    Incessant subtle noise fills the space, while   sunlight enters through the large window and illuminates the grey, but   complex textured wall. It is a music that fits the room, and induces   the occasional hypnoticizing synaesthetic feeling. Texture, an   inherently synaesthetic term when applied to music, is what this music   is about. The subtle field recordings document insignificant sounds,   that are easily neglected in everyday life, however become all the more   enjoyable submerged in the organic drones of this music.

    A phenomenal listening experience, otherworldly drones from a bunch of 'Buddha machines'.  Henke - The FM3 Buddha Machine is a low-fi loop playing device containing nine pre-recorded loops which cannot be changed by the user. Due to manufacturing imperfections, individual machines play the loops with a slightly different sound, pitch and duration. The built-in playbackcircuit, with its low sampling rate and bit resolution, produces a very rough sound, similar to ancient computer games or talking toys. Rich, spacious textures and moving echoes occur when many of these machines are played at the same time.

  <div class="content">
    <img style="width:100%;" src=" img/GavinBryars_1975.jpg ">
    The sinking of the Titanic is maybe  the seminal work of Gavin Bryars. A wonderful orchestral piece with strong  influences from minimal and ambient music, yet retaining a classical  orchestral atmosphere. The slow string movements combined with the  suggestion of a sinking ship give a strange soothing feel. The B-side  contains the mesmerizing piece 'Jesus' blood never failed me yet',  consisting of a looping recording of an old british homeless poor man,  expressing his faith in the divine grace with an almost enlightened aura.  It is a simple, yet one of the most wonderful pieces ever made.

  <div class="header">Asher - Landscape Studies (2009)</div>
  <div class="content">
    <img style="width:100%;" src=" img/asher_landscape.jpg ">
    A point of rest, a subtle but rich landscape or a   miniature. A close up of an at first glance uninteresting artefact.   These high notes dive in the lonesome and calming grey winter evening.   It's rare, a music for a scene as grey and dark as the album cover that   is yet so comforting.  Never have I appreciated electronic monotonous   noise more than in the subtle washes of these landscape studies.

    Wonderful album from  the duo Linus, consisting of Ruben Machtelinckx (guitar) and Thomas  Jillings (clarinet). From te first time I heard it on the Klara late night  radio show I knew it ws some of the finest jazz music I'd ever hear.

    Drift away to Lieven Martens'  distant islands, so well documented in his compositions. No weird exotic  cheesyness here, real non-ironic exotic programme music.

    Once bought in a record sale when  someone saw me with a record of Brian Eno and said - 'you will like this'.  The guy was right, this is still one of my major essential records. A  careful exploration of slowliness with ordinary instruments. It is really a  quiet city.

  <div class="content">
    <img style="width:100%;" src=" img/johnson.jpg ">
    A wonderful gift, not only from Dennis   Johnson, but also from Kyle Gann, who transcribed the piece 50 years   after its conception, and R. Andrew Lee, who so devotedly directs his   pianism to the wonderful tonal minimal works and does not recoil for   this 4 hour piece. Also the label, Irritable hedgehog should be thanked   for their wonderful contributions to my collection. November is the  quintessential minimal piano music, a music that induces a  certain state of disillusioning calm, a waking-up alone after a  night of rain.
