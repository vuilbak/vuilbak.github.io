    <p>I am not sure whether an epistemology of science is the correct way to talk about this. I could just call it Rosen’s epistemological foundations for science or simply Rosen’s epistemology. At any rate, I am concerned with Robert Rosen’s epistemology as outlined in ‘Life Itself’, in particular chapter 3.</p>

<p>Rosen opens with a discussion of what he regards two basic dualisms in the epistemological basis of science:</p>

<ol>
  <li>INNER WORLD - AMBIENCE (§ 3B)</li>
  <li>SYSTEMS - ENVIRONMENTS (§ 3C)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first of these - the discrimination between the <strong>inner world</strong>, or the “subjective world of the self” vs. the <strong>ambience</strong> or “objective reality” or “objective world of phenomena” - is a cornerstone of most western metaphysics. Rosen calls this separation “absolute, indubitable and unequivocal, though it may be different for different selves”.</p>

<p>Under subjective world of the self, Rosen understands the Cartesian ‘cogito’ in it’s broad sense, that is the self and all its cognitive activities. Is Rosen making some rationalist commitment? Probably not, by characterizing the ambience as the “objective world of phenomena” and by equaling this with “the world of objective reality” he seems to adopt a Kantian epistemology. Can Rosen in general be described as some sort of neo-Kantian?</p>

<p>Rosen claims science to be in need of both aspects of this basic metaphysical/epistemological dualism and regards the scientific enterprise as a way (and explicitly states “perhaps not the only way”) to <em>internalize</em> the ambience. Reminding us of the characterization of science as a ‘creative interface’ between man and nature of Prigogine &amp; Stengers.</p>

<p>Rosen further describes science as committing oneself to the partitioning of the ambience into <strong>system</strong> and <strong>environment</strong>, and <em>imputing</em> this partitioning to the ambience as an inherent property thereof. This seems to be a kind of ‘leap of faith’ made in science. This basic partitioning is according to Rosen <em>not given in any way</em>, contrasting it starkly with the unshakable necessity of the first dualism. The characterization of science as the partitioning of and imputing to the ambience while not relying on the givenness of such a partitioning seems to mark science as a fundamental creative activity.</p>

<p>How does Rosen define this partitioning, <em>i.e.</em> what do we understand under ‘system’, ‘systemhood’ and ‘environment’? According to Rosen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] a system in the ambience is a collection of <strong>percepts</strong> that seem to <strong>us</strong> to belong together.” (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where Rosen remarks the close relationship with <em>set-ness</em> and specifies the environment in these terms as the complement of the system. Interestingly, this definition makes systemhood largely dependent on the subject, and again seems to make a kind of Kantian commitment. A system is defined by percepts, that is aspects of reality that affect the subject, that are organized by us, subjectively into some coherent whole. It is some imposed organization of a subset of phenomena (or what these bring forth?) that make out the ambience. A Rosennian system therefore seems to depend on the scientist that does the partitioning, and is thus not given <em>as such</em>.</p>

<p>He remarks that a “system is something familiar in experience yet alien as we try to characterize it, as a thing-in-itself, apart from any specific material embodiment”. In this remarkable claim it feels as if Rosen does commit himself to an independent existence of systems. Can we interpret this as if a system is something that in principle exists independently of material embodiment? Or does he merely point at the existence of such a system subjectively, that is, in our minds (accordingly abstracted from material embodiment)? Is a system something that exists in the ambience, in the subject or in both?</p>
